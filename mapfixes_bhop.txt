rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
11750977271 - Alley - End compatible with new physics + spawn fixed - There's a weird part in the middle of the start zone that you bump into
11225546578 - Around The Round - fixed start - WHERE ARE THE PLATFORMS
11117971522 - Colossus - remake - going through the teleport spawns you in the wall, check spawns (9th spawn does not exist, other issues)
11750867663 - Dust - End used to clip through last block - Change is too small for a time wipe
10057239529 - FrozenRuins - Trigger skip after bounce pad no longer possible. - This trigger skip does not detract from the map in my opinion.  May need to have a vote to see what people think.
