submitted unreleased fixes:

uploaded, wipe:

tested, pending upload & wipe:
13546392986 - Moderated - Fix the start trigger skip and later rng trigger skip - aidan and miners were arguing about whether to just make the rng scrip consistent instead and avoid a wipe

submitted fixes (wipe times):
12687188945 - Reddish - misplaced invisible wall fixed, wall wedge at the end is now collidable (do not wipe bonus times)
15563027754 - Zyper - Changed the mesh stage's collision to Triggers instead of Platforms to prevent speed boost

tested, pending upload:

submitted fixes (no wipe):
15360707260 - emevaelx3 - Fix a couple entrance headhits that force awkward gameplay
8642318889 - BrickColors - Some changes and fixes to the statue room (Hall of Champions)
15715735128 - Adventure V2 - Fixed bumping into invis part in shortcut stage
15928762607 - Bruh - Resized some parts at last climb to make it less insufferable
15928670748 - Pohb - Changed map name so it's "Pohb" and not "Pohb not idiot"
15928885889 - Rising - Fixed weird platforms that had a Jump0/Trigger inside of a Platform, causing weird client desync

add map data:

tested, pending upload & add map data:

submitted fixes need add map data:
13815854648 - Clarion - Map was removed from game. I removed the "alternate reality" part for now. There's probably a way to make it work on new phsyics but I don't care. Also updated lighting for Future lighting.

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
10060990749 - Synced V2 (COPYLOCKED) - Fixed RNG jump next to ladder (moved rock blocks up 0.2 studs) - This map loads a script with require in the lighting script.
11750977271 - Alley - End compatible with new physics + spawn fixed - There's a weird part in the middle of the start zone that you bump into
11117971522 - Colossus - remake - going through the teleport spawns you in the wall, check spawns (9th spawn does not exist, other issues)
11750867663 - Dust - End used to clip through last block - Change is too small for a time wipe
10057239529 - FrozenRuins - Trigger skip after bounce pad no longer possible. - This trigger skip does not detract from the map in my opinion.  May need to have a vote to see what people think.
3889303022 bhop-fus - fixed lighting problems on first stage - still suffers from sliding on spawns
14311240482 - High segdaB - The physics bug as described in map_issues.txt does not appear to be happening anymore. Fixed impossible jump towards the end - brah this map sucks I'm deleting it
13118097070 - Y - Re-port using import plugin. Scaled up. - excuse me the boosters aren't supposed to give horizontal boost
