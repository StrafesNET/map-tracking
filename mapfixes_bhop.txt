uploaded, wipe:
12199296971 - I DROPPED MY HECKIN POP-TARTS!! - Fixed being able to stand on top of pop-tart boxes while in start zone and complete map by bhopping on top of the boxes. (Apparently the fix I used to submit the trigger skip fix did not have this? I am not sure as to what happened but oh well)
13160900471 - Colorize - Fix mis-named spawn skipping most of the map
13199981229 - Cubelights - Fix exposed trigger leading to triggerskip
11479539460 - Ambience - startzone no longer extends above the walls, terrain no longer has collision
12687188945 - Reddish - misplaced invisible wall fixed, wall wedge at the end is now collidable (do not wipe bonus times)

tested, pending upload:

submitted fixes (no wipe):
10060990749 - Synced V2 (COPYLOCKED) - Fixed RNG jump next to ladder (moved rock blocks up 0.2 studs)
12945532940 - Golf Yourself - Removed spawnlocation object leading to annoying forcefields
13553729461 - Lavender - Fixes the lighting for future lighting (The lights were on about 10k brightness). Note that the core physics bug behind the map not working still exists (See PR for more detail)
13737735520 - Way Back When - Fixes a mis-named spawn leading to the equivilant of a trigger skip. Doesn't need wiping as it's currently unknown and unused
13818144033 - Alvo 2 - Stopped the surf on the last stage clipping into itself
13851818252 - Koi - Fixed the broken ladder (A lot of green appears to be slightly rotated by like .002 degrees, which doesn't really matter, except for on the ladder, where the physics is awful)
13851883406 - Drewfc was being uncool - Fixed the incredibly awkward headhitting on stage 34
13852057384 - Arcane V2 - Raised the roof at stage 61 to avoid awkward headhitting and fixed weird offset flooring in stage 63 (nothing incredibly important)

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
11750977271 - Alley - End compatible with new physics + spawn fixed - There's a weird part in the middle of the start zone that you bump into
11225546578 - Around The Round - fixed start - WHERE ARE THE PLATFORMS
11117971522 - Colossus - remake - going through the teleport spawns you in the wall, check spawns (9th spawn does not exist, other issues)
11750867663 - Dust - End used to clip through last block - Change is too small for a time wipe
10057239529 - FrozenRuins - Trigger skip after bounce pad no longer possible. - This trigger skip does not detract from the map in my opinion.  May need to have a vote to see what people think.
3889303022 bhop-fus - fixed lighting problems on first stage - still suffers from sliding on spawns
