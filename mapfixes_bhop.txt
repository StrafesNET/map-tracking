submitted fixes need add map data:
13815854648 - Clarion - Map was removed from game. I removed the "alternate reality" part for now. There's probably a way to make it work on new phsyics but I don't care. Also updated lighting for Future lighting.

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
10060990749 - Synced V2 (COPYLOCKED) - Fixed RNG jump next to ladder (moved rock blocks up 0.2 studs) - This map loads a script with require in the lighting script.
11750977271 - Alley - End compatible with new physics + spawn fixed - There's a weird part in the middle of the start zone that you bump into
11117971522 - Colossus - remake - going through the teleport spawns you in the wall, check spawns (9th spawn does not exist, other issues)
11750867663 - Dust - End used to clip through last block - Change is too small for a time wipe
10057239529 - FrozenRuins - Trigger skip after bounce pad no longer possible. - This trigger skip does not detract from the map in my opinion.  May need to have a vote to see what people think.
3889303022 bhop-fus - fixed lighting problems on first stage - still suffers from sliding on spawns
14311240482 - High segdaB - The physics bug as described in map_issues.txt does not appear to be happening anymore. Fixed impossible jump towards the end - brah this map sucks I'm deleting it
13118097070 - Y - Re-port using import plugin. Scaled up. - excuse me the boosters aren't supposed to give horizontal boost
16042545662 - deep chicago night (fix: polyrhythm) - end ramp converted to a Surf to prevent speed loss - this should be fixed in the physics, not like this - same opinion as before, this is a workaround and not a root cause and makes the map worse for casual players
16503936411 - Questionable Trials - Fixed being able to do a difficult jump around teleport - script loaders are not allowed, use a Script with RunContext set to Client
