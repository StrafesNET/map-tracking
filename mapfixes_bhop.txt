submitted unreleased fixes:

uploaded, wipe:

tested, pending upload & wipe:
13546392986 - Moderated - Fix the start trigger skip and later rng trigger skip - aidan and miners were arguing about whether to just make the rng scrip consistent instead and avoid a wipe

submitted fixes (wipe times):

tested, pending upload:
13851883406 - Drewfc was being uncool - Fixed the incredibly awkward headhitting on stage 34 - Stopped putting scripts in backpacks
14723879660 - Emblem 6 - Fix the anticheat near the start being too close to the MapStart zone - Stopped putting scripts in backpacks
14860882046 - Hidden place - Fixed oob + Added missing part - Stopped putting scripts in backpacks
14861051737 - Solitude - Fix a dumb slope boost near start (see https://discord.com/channels/167423382697148416/167423382697148416/1120940605124648970). Also updated lighting for Future lighting - Stopped putting scripts in backpacks

submitted fixes (no wipe):
14807871641 - Badges 2 - Make the forced longjumps (s14 -> s16) play a bit better, prevent bizarre wall jumping behaviour

add map data:

tested, pending upload & add map data:
14517133487 - Danmark - Fixed teleports - can't find the stupid asset id
14516936733 - Tide - Removed the invisible secret path that leads straight to the end - can't find the stupid asset id
14516987139 - Touch - Fixed headhits - can't find the stupid asset id

submitted fixes need add map data:
13815854648 - Clarion - Map was removed from game. I removed the "alternate reality" part for now. There's probably a way to make it work on new phsyics but I don't care. Also updated lighting for Future lighting.

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
10060990749 - Synced V2 (COPYLOCKED) - Fixed RNG jump next to ladder (moved rock blocks up 0.2 studs) - This map loads a script with require in the lighting script.
11750977271 - Alley - End compatible with new physics + spawn fixed - There's a weird part in the middle of the start zone that you bump into
11117971522 - Colossus - remake - going through the teleport spawns you in the wall, check spawns (9th spawn does not exist, other issues)
11750867663 - Dust - End used to clip through last block - Change is too small for a time wipe
10057239529 - FrozenRuins - Trigger skip after bounce pad no longer possible. - This trigger skip does not detract from the map in my opinion.  May need to have a vote to see what people think.
3889303022 bhop-fus - fixed lighting problems on first stage - still suffers from sliding on spawns
14311240482 - High segdaB - The physics bug as described in map_issues.txt does not appear to be happening anymore. Fixed impossible jump towards the end - brah this map sucks I'm deleting it
13118097070 - Y - Re-port using import plugin. Scaled up. - excuse me the boosters aren't supposed to give horizontal boost
