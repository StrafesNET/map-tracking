add map data:

tested, pending upload & add map data:

submitted fixes need add map data:
13815854648 - Clarion - Map was removed from game. I removed the "alternate reality" part for now. There's probably a way to make it work on new phsyics but I don't care. Also updated lighting for Future lighting.
14311128894 - Around The Round - Fixed bizarre ground-surfing behaviour on the spawn platform, map now works fine
14311240482 - High segdaB - The physics bug as described in map_issues.txt does not appear to be happening anymore. Fixed impossible jump towards the end
14512222872 - Dawn2 - Fixed impossible spot due to hitbox
14512310428 - Dev V1 - Fixed impossible jumps
14512630110 - Xerox - Fixed impossible vent at s 28

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
10060990749 - Synced V2 (COPYLOCKED) - Fixed RNG jump next to ladder (moved rock blocks up 0.2 studs) - This map loads a script with require in the lighting script.
11750977271 - Alley - End compatible with new physics + spawn fixed - There's a weird part in the middle of the start zone that you bump into
11225546578 - Around The Round - fixed start - WHERE ARE THE PLATFORMS
11117971522 - Colossus - remake - going through the teleport spawns you in the wall, check spawns (9th spawn does not exist, other issues)
11750867663 - Dust - End used to clip through last block - Change is too small for a time wipe
10057239529 - FrozenRuins - Trigger skip after bounce pad no longer possible. - This trigger skip does not detract from the map in my opinion.  May need to have a vote to see what people think.
3889303022 bhop-fus - fixed lighting problems on first stage - still suffers from sliding on spawns
