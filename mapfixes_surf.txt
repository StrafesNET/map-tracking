upload but don't add to game:

uploaded, wipe:
12200007846 - Daydreamer II - Another ramp segment had its velocity set to (500,0,0), I have therefore checked through every single map part and removed other ramps with velocity to then get rid of the problem entirely. (Only delete times which use the skip; times under ~1:20)

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
852889271 - Golden Glory - ramp fix - fall through ramp???
770953991 - Halloween - ramp fix - spines still bad, candy corn stage is unnecessarily hard due to the hitbox, some ramps kill you
10066332884 - O-oh hi-i t-there, J-J-Jill - spawn is buggy, bumpy ramps, especially 2nd ramp
12947656819 - Skewed - the bonus is actually possible for new physics now cuz of a stupid fat wall (fix made by Duckadvice) - stage 2 teleport to stage 3 has a part in the way
621876510 - Space Jam - idk - there is already a great fix published
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
459306841 - Winterland - ramp fix - needs more fixes, still bumpy ramps
