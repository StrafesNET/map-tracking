rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
16249231648 - Kyoto - Resized start zone to prevent height advantage from leaving and re entering start zone (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - changing position of mapstart will mess with bots.
16249306971 - Slope - Resized start zone to prevent height advantage from leaving and re entering start zone (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - ditto above.
16249264391 - Shard - Resized start zone to prevent height advantage from leaving and re entering start zone (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - ditto above above.
2637387680 - Accident 2 - fixed halloween stage - blocked due to lighting fixer - use a Script with RunContext set to Client instead of a loader
