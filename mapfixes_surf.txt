5272229281 (MAP FIX!) (not sure what was fixed)

upload but don't add to game:

uploaded, wipe:
10077886389 - Submerged - Fixed gap in wall used in route. - Was the gap intentional?
12200450586 - TrueCetric - fixed Trigger2 parts letting you phase through them due to no Spawn2

tested, pending upload & wipe:

submitted fixes (wipe times):
12200007846 - Daydreamer II - Another ramp segment had its velocity set to (500,0,0), I have therefore checked through every single map part and removed other ramps with velocity to then get rid of the problem entirely. (Only delete times which use the skip; times under ~1:20)

tested, pending upload:

submitted fixes (no wipe):
12947510568 - Cyberspace - bonus zones and ramp spines (fix made by Duckadvice)
12947589185 - Oh (the one with the funny characters that i dont know how to get) - bonus zone and ramp spines (fix made by Duckadvice)
12947656819 - Skewed - the bonus is actually possible for new physics now cuz of a stupid fat wall (fix made by Duckadvice)
12947779682 - Clove - trigger fix on stage 2 + ramp fixes and bonus zones (fix made by Duckadvice & OneDreamerz)

add map data:
10076615800 - 30 Minutes (removed) - Removed the ability to get on top of the telehop.

11234923029 - Mane Six - anti tele traps player
11224975215 - Slime Map Pile - added SetVel
11226695678 - Trikz Cloud - added SetVel
11760638857 - Water Park - Hitbox was too big to fit through a hole
12459832109 - Tube Tactics - fixed bumpy ramps and made hole bigger

tested, pending upload & add map data:

submitted fixes need add map data:
569053285 - Sand Temple - now possible - delayed due to moving parts being bad

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
852889271 - Golden Glory - ramp fix - fall through ramp???
770953991 - Halloween - ramp fix - spines still bad, candy corn stage is unnecessarily hard due to the hitbox, some ramps kill you
10066332884 - O-oh hi-i t-there, J-J-Jill - spawn is buggy, bumpy ramps, especially 2nd ramp
621876510 - Space Jam - idk - there is already a great fix published
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
459306841 - Winterland - ramp fix - needs more fixes, still bumpy ramps
