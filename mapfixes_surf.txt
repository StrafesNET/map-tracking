upload but don't add to game:

uploaded, wipe:
12200007846 - Daydreamer II - Another ramp segment had its velocity set to (500,0,0), I have therefore checked through every single map part and removed other ramps with velocity to then get rid of the problem entirely. (Only delete times which use the skip; times under ~1:20)
12947779682 - Clove - trigger fix on stage 2 + ramp fixes and bonus zones (fix made by Duckadvice & OneDreamerz)

tested, pending upload & wipe:

submitted fixes (wipe times):
7789455753 - 4 AM - Added roof and fixed Bonus1 booster. Added anti resurfs. Faste times need to be wiped
4899023713 - surf_Airspace (added extra walls around each stage, starting playforms renamed to "Jump3"

tested, pending upload:

submitted fixes (no wipe):
12615410485 - surf_pain (updated ID) bonus 4 endzone fix.
12653616137 - surf_Mini (fixes skip) (creator doesn't know if skip was found by anyone other than himself, if there are times with skip, wipe those times.)


add map data:
10076615800 - 30 Minutes (removed) - Removed the ability to get on top of the telehop.

tested, pending upload & add map data:

submitted fixes need add map data:
569053285 - Sand Temple - now possible - delayed due to moving parts being bad

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
852889271 - Golden Glory - ramp fix - fall through ramp???
770953991 - Halloween - ramp fix - spines still bad, candy corn stage is unnecessarily hard due to the hitbox, some ramps kill you
10066332884 - O-oh hi-i t-there, J-J-Jill - spawn is buggy, bumpy ramps, especially 2nd ramp
12947656819 - Skewed - the bonus is actually possible for new physics now cuz of a stupid fat wall (fix made by Duckadvice) - stage 2 teleport to stage 3 has a part in the way
621876510 - Space Jam - idk - there is already a great fix published
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
459306841 - Winterland - ramp fix - needs more fixes, still bumpy ramps
