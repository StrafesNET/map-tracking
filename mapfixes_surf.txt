rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
852889271 - Golden Glory - ramp fix - fall through ramp???
770953991 - Halloween - ramp fix - spines still bad, candy corn stage is unnecessarily hard due to the hitbox, some ramps kill you
10066332884 - O-oh hi-i t-there, J-J-Jill - spawn is buggy, bumpy ramps, especially 2nd ramp
621876510 - Space Jam - idk - there is already a great fix published
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
459306841 - Winterland - ramp fix - needs more fixes, still bumpy ramps
4899023713 - surf_Airspace (added extra walls around each stage, starting playforms renamed to "Jump3" - testers saying it's not possible, maybe missing a ramp?
12615410485 - surf_pain (updated ID) bonus 4 endzone fix. - use execution context instead of a script distributor for local scripts.
14214740439 - Memorial - rampfix, better lighting & textures, new skybox - the spine fix ruins the surf made of 6 wedges with a concavity underneath
5272229281 - Luminous - made possible - lower the surfs a bit, you can't walk off some spawns onto the surfs
13605711173 - Ineffable - made possible - ramp textures are wack on the ends, map is harder because of tall hitbox
13634743943 - Ineffable 2 - made possible - ramp with z fighting causes physics issues 2 ramps before circle spin thing, map is harder because of tall hitbox
14122828826 - Sandstorm Supergiant - made possible - not adjusted for new physics enough, lighting needs fix
14422792918 - Regret - Fixed oob & MapFinish sizing - it's insanely dark
16250123347 - Regret - Resized start and end zone to prevent shenanigans and disabled Cast Shadow so you can see map (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - changing the position of the start zone requires a full wipe since the bots are based on the start zone position.  Is this really worth a full wipe?
16249231648 - Kyoto - Resized start zone to prevent height advantage from leaving and re entering start zone (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - ditto above.
16249306971 - Slope - Resized start zone to prevent height advantage from leaving and re entering start zone (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - ditto above above.
