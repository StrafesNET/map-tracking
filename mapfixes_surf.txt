rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.

13634743943 - Ineffable 2 - made possible - ramp with z fighting causes physics issues 2 ramps before circle spin thing, map is harder because of tall hitbox
14122828826 - Sandstorm Supergiant - made possible - not adjusted for new physics enough, lighting needs fix
