852889271 - Golden Glory - ramp fix - fall through ramp???
10066332884 - O-oh hi-i t-there, J-J-Jill - spawn is buggy, bumpy ramps, especially 2nd ramp
621876510 - Space Jam - idk - there is already a great fix published
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
459306841 - Winterland - ramp fix - needs more fixes, still bumpy ramps
12615410485 - surf_pain (updated ID) bonus 4 endzone fix. - use execution context instead of a script distributor for local scripts.

16250123347 - Regret - Resized start and end zone to prevent shenanigans and disabled Cast Shadow so you can see map (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - changing the position of the start zone requires a full wipe since the bots are based on the start zone position.  Is this really worth a full wipe?
16249231648 - Kyoto - Resized start zone to prevent height advantage from leaving and re entering start zone (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - ditto above.
