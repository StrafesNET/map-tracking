submitted fixes (no wipe):

add map data:
10076615800 - 30 Minutes (removed) - Removed the ability to get on top of the telehop.
12116717615 - Got The Blues - Fixed bhopsurf, lighting, broken spawn, and bonusstart/finish
11234923029 - Mane Six - anti tele traps player
11224975215 - Slime Map Pile - added SetVel
11226695678 - Trikz Cloud - added SetVel
11760638857 - Water Park - Hitbox was too big to fit through a hole

tested, pending upload & add map data:
12200007846 - Daydreamer 2 - End teleport fixed, you ACTUALLY teleport to the end now
11760638857 - Water Park - Hitbox was too big to fit through a hole

submitted fixes need add map data:
569053285 - Sand Temple - now possible - delayed due to moving parts being bad

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
10375338147 - Elementary - switched b3 to b1 - I don't like how the SetVelocity parts are ground level, they should be above the jump height and you spawn into them so you can't touch them while jumping on the spawn
852889271 - Golden Glory - ramp fix - fall through ramp???
770953991 - Halloween - ramp fix - spines still bad, candy corn stage is unnecessarily hard due to the hitbox, some ramps kill you
10066332884 - O-oh hi-i t-there, J-J-Jill - spawn is buggy, bumpy ramps, especially 2nd ramp
621876510 - Space Jam - idk - there is already a great fix published
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
459306841 - Winterland - ramp fix - needs more fixes, still bumpy ramps
