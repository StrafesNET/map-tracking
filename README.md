# I want to fix maps
Give me a list of ids/maps and I will send you up to date map files for whichever maps you want to fix.

## How to send in your edits using github
1. Fork this project using the button on the github page
2. Create a new branch named whatever you like
3. Edit mapfixes_bhop.txt or mapfixes_surf.txt with your uploaded model ids, commit your changes to your new branch
4. Make a Pull Request requesting to merge your branch into the main branch in this repository

### I already have a fork, how do I submit more edits
This is where making a new branch comes in handy.  You can use the "Sync fork" button on your fork's main branch page to sync the changes since the last time you submitted, and then make a new branch again.

### I don't want to do any of this
That's ok, you can just DM me the information and I will add it here.
